## What is this?

CodeGraph builds a complete semantic graph of your codebase — every function, class, import, and call relationship across **32 programming languages** — and makes it instantly available to AI coding agents through the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP).

When Claude Code, Codex, or any MCP-compatible agent enters your project, CodeGraph gives it an immediate, deep understanding of your entire codebase: what calls what, what depends on what, what breaks if you change something. Not file-level grep — **graph-aware, semantically-ranked, token-budgeted context**.

**v0.2.5** adds git integration, security scanning (OWASP/CWE), call graph analysis, data flow analysis, a YAML configuration system, structured logging, and robust multi-byte character handling.

## Getting Started

Two steps. That's it.

### Step 1: Install the binary

Pick one:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/workmule/codegraph/main/install.sh | bash
```

```bash
brew tap workmule/codegraph && brew install codegraph
```

```bash
npx @workmule/codegraph init
```

```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features
```

### Step 2: Initialize your project

```bash
codegraph init
```

This single command indexes your codebase, registers the MCP server, installs lifecycle hooks, generates CLAUDE.md, and sets up git hooks.

Open Claude Code and your project is already graph-aware.

## What happens after init?

### On every session start
The SessionStart hook triggers an incremental re-index (~12ms when nothing changed). Your graph is always fresh.

### On every prompt you send
The UserPromptSubmit hook searches the graph for context relevant to your message and injects it automatically. The agent sees the right code before it even starts thinking.

### Before every tool call
The PreToolUse hook injects relevant codebase context before Edit, Write, Read, Grep, Glob, and Bash calls. The agent knows which symbols are in the file before it even opens it.

### On every file Claude edits
The PostToolUse hook re-indexes the modified file instantly. The graph stays in sync with changes as they happen.

### When a tool fails
The PostToolUseFailure hook provides corrective context — if a function was renamed or moved, CodeGraph tells the agent where to find it now.

### When subagents spawn
The SubagentStart hook injects a compact project overview (top symbols, frameworks, file counts) into every subagent. They start with full codebase awareness from turn one.

### Before conversation compaction
The PreCompact hook saves a PageRank summary of the most important symbols. Structural awareness survives even when conversation history gets compressed.

### Before the agent stops
The Stop hook checks for graph inconsistencies (high unresolved reference ratio) and can suggest the agent continue to address them before stopping.

### When a task completes
The TaskCompleted hook runs a quality gate — re-indexes the project and reports any new dead code or unresolved references introduced during the task.

### When a session ends
The SessionEnd hook runs a final incremental re-index and logs session-level diagnostics (file count, node count, edge count, unresolved refs).

## Performance

| Metric | Without CodeGraph | With CodeGraph | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tokens per task | ~5,000 | ~1,550 | **68% fewer** |
| Files examined | 11 (all) | 3 avg | **73% fewer** |
| Index 54 files | N/A | **230ms** | Sub-second |
| Incremental no-op | N/A | **13ms** | Instant |
| CPU utilization | N/A | **600%+** | Parallel parsing via rayon |

### Token Reduction Benchmarks

Measured on a real 11-file TypeScript project with ground truth evaluation:

| Task Query | Baseline Tokens | CodeGraph Tokens | Reduction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Authentication login | 4,962 | 1,997 | **59.8%** |
| Database connection | 4,962 | 1,305 | **73.7%** |
| User repository | 4,962 | 2,108 | **57.5%** |
| API routes handlers | 4,962 | 935 | **81.2%** |
| Password hashing | 4,962 | 1,522 | **69.3%** |
| **Average** | | | **68.3%** |

### Quality Metrics (Evaluation Framework)

| Category | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| Caller detection | 1.00 | 1.00 | **1.00** |
| Dead code detection | 0.75 | 1.00 | **0.86** |
| Search relevance | 0.27 | 0.58 | **0.37** |

Caller detection achieves perfect precision and recall — CodeGraph never misses a caller and never hallucinates one.

- **50+ rules** covering SQL injection, XSS, command injection, hardcoded secrets, weak crypto, and more
- **Taint analysis**: Source-to-sink data flow tracking for injection vulnerabilities
- **Custom rules**: Write your own YAML rules with regex patterns, severity, CWE/OWASP mappings

```bash
codegraph scan-security        # Full scan with all rules
codegraph check-owasp          # OWASP Top 10 only
codegraph check-cwe            # CWE Top 25 only
```

## Configuration

CodeGraph supports layered YAML configuration:

```yaml
# .codegraph.yaml (project-level) or ~/.config/codegraph/config.yaml (user-level)
version: "1.0"
preset: balanced  # minimal | balanced | full | security-focused

tools:
  overrides:
    codegraph_dead_code:
      enabled: false
      reason: "Too noisy for this project"

performance:
  exclude_tests: true
```

**4 presets**: `minimal` (15 tools), `balanced` (30 tools), `full` (all 44), `security-focused`

**Auto editor detection**: Claude Code → full, VS Code → balanced, Zed → minimal

**Environment overrides**: `CODEGRAPH_PRESET`, `CODEGRAPH_DISABLED_TOOLS`

## Building from Source

```bash
# Prerequisites: Rust 1.75+, C compiler (for tree-sitter + SQLite)

# Full build with embeddings
cargo build --release

# Without embeddings (keyword-only search, leaner binary)
cargo build --release --no-default-features

# Run the test suite (2065 tests)
cargo test
```

## Uninstall

```bash
# Remove the binary
rm ~/.local/bin/codegraph

# Remove project data (run inside each project you initialized)
rm -rf .codegraph/
codegraph git-hooks uninstall

# Remove Claude Code integration files (optional, check before deleting)
rm .mcp.json
rm -rf .claude/
```

## Design Decisions

- **Sync core, async only at the MCP boundary.** tree-sitter and rusqlite are synchronous. Tokio is used only for the rmcp stdio transport.
- **Native tree-sitter, not WASM.** 32 grammars statically linked. No initialization delay, no runtime downloads.
- **Code-specific embeddings.** Jina v2 Base Code (768-dim) understands programming language semantics, not just natural language.
- **Feature-gated embeddings.** Build with `--no-default-features` for a leaner binary that does keyword-only search.
- **Hooks never panic.** Every handler uses `catch_unwind` and always returns valid JSON. CodeGraph never blocks your agent.
- **Idempotent everything.** Running `init` twice produces the same result. Hooks are marker-based. Config merges are additive.
- **Qualified names by containment.** `Class.method` names are derived from line-range enclosure — works across all 32 languages without language-specific logic.
- **Structured logging.** Uses the `tracing` crate with `RUST_LOG` support. Path traversal protection and secret redaction on all MCP tool inputs/outputs.
